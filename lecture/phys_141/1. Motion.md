Use a [[particle model]] to simplify

Representations of motion:
- Graphs
- Vectors
- Motion diagrams
	- Positions separated by equal intervals of time
- Mathematical

> **Kinematics**
> A pure description of motion (no causes, just description)

> **Position**
> Where something is at an instant in time
> $$ arrow(r) $$
> I.e. a vector from the origin to the location of the object.

$arrow(i)$, $arrow(j)$, and $arrow(k)$ are unit vectors in the xyz coordinate system.

> **Displacement**
> $$ Delta arrow(r) equiv arrow(r)_2 - arrow(r)_1 $$

> **Time interval**
> $$ Delta t = t_2 - t_1 $$

> **Velocity**
> $$ arrow(v)_"avg" equiv (Delta arrow(r)) / (Delta t) $$

Recall:
$$ arrow(r)_2 = arrow(r)_1 + Delta arrow(r) = arrow(r)_1 + arrow(v)_"avg" Delta t $$

Non-constant velocity is indicated by a non-constant first derivative on the position graph of an object.

> **Instantaneous velocity**
> Let $Delta arrow(x) arrow d arrow(x)$
> $Delta t arrow d t$
> $$ arrow(v) equiv (d arrow(x)) / (d t) $$
> $d t$ must be small enough that $arrow(v)$ looks constant.
