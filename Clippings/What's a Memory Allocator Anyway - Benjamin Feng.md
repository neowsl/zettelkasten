### Title

**0:07** · you Benjamin Fang is not only our first speaker today but also our first returning speaker ever normally I try to make a joke in the introduction but this time all I want to say is Thank You Benjamin for your courage and your effort this talk today is the first talk that we are hosting meant to introduce newcomers to the C programming language to a systems programming concept the title is what's a memory allocator anyway and Benjamin the zoom is yours

### Talk

**0:41** · hi thanks for the introduction Laurie and it's good to be back and let's get started with our talk so as Laurie's has just mentioned my talk is going to be on memory allocator specifically manual memory allocation and to understand what is a memory allocator we need to understand why is a memory allocator and that's actually a

**1:02** · pretty good question because let's take a look at what the z compiler will provide for us so this is just a very simple simple function that I wrote up real quick all it does is it takes two variables they start in an end and it goes and it sums up everything in the middle now how that word looks in the in the actual compiler is that we will be provided a segment of memory at the very

**1:27** · top is going to be some function metadata specifically to return address but it may include some other things in there and then we have the two variables that we're passing in let's pretend that this is a very dumb compiler and we're not using registers so we're gonna reserve start and end as as part of the

**1:45** · memory that we need in in our execution and then we also need the result in the current and the result is the data that we returned back and the current is sort of a temporary 6 and this is all the memory that we need for running this function every time you invoke this function it will so the compiler will go ahead and just reserve all this space for you and the the nice thing about

**2:06** · this is you don't have to think about it as a general programmer I never have to really think about any of this stuff because it's all automatic like stack memory is handled by the compiler is handled really well because it has a very simple semantics and you know exactly what's gonna go happen it's very fast at allocating because you literally just advance a pointer a couple of steps

**2:27** · so that you have enough memory and you also have because everything is predetermined by the compiler the compiler will literally just write a bunch of offsets in the middle of your code it doesn't have to calculate any of that it's just there purely based on what's in the stack right now so everything is fast and cleanup is just

**2:46** · the opposite you just unwind able to a single pointer so everything's fast and everything is basically trivial to the compiler so why isn't this good enough for for all programs why do we need a concept of manual memory allocation like there are there are some fundamental limitations on how you can use the stack

**3:04** · and the first big problem is you have a fixed amount of total memory and this depending on which operating system you run this may be a little bit more flexible into how much fixed total memory you have but generally speaking you're not you're never gonna be able to allocate gigabytes on the stack that's just something that the operating system will not allow you to do for for pretty good reasons so even if you are able to

**3:27** · expand the stack you're still having a limit as to this is not the total memory if you want 16 gigabytes you need some other way of accessing that memory you also have a problem with fixed sizes because the compiler needs to know exactly how big the memory space is for every variable in your program and so this must be fixed and if you need any sort of dynamic allocation for instance if you don't know the size of something or you need to like expand the size at

**3:57** · some point this is not really possible on a stack I mean it's it's a little bit possible in some operating system like Linux gets you allocate which allows you to expand a stack variables Xing actually doesn't let you do that because it was found to be unsound and buggy so we can't actually do that in zig and we don't want to do that in Zig a workaround here is you can allocate a maximum buffer size and that way you can

**4:22** · sort of have a maximum size that you can allocate boards but if that maximum size is not big enough to handle say user inputs then then your city your your program can't actually operate on that and the last problem is life times because of the way that the stack is structured it only that the lifetime of

**4:41** · this variable only exists inside this function call or in Zig it's actually inside of a specific block and that's kind of a profit that's not a problem if you're using values directly so if you're always copying around the start value the end value that's not a problem because you're just passing around values as soon as you use pointers pointers into stack memory can easily be

**5:02** · hanging references and that's the same that's the same type of bug as I use after free bug and least a memory corruption and all sorts of really bad things and because you don't have control over your lifetime you can't build something like a linked list on a stack and return it so these are all sort of very big limitations with how the compiler works with matter and it's in general you want to use

**5:28** · second memory as much as possible but if you run into these limitations you can't really leverage the stack any more so what do you do well let's let's come up with the simplest allocation strategy the easiest way to do manual memory allocation is by making someone else do it so like the operating system gives us a way to ask for more memory and what you

**5:51** · see what that looks like and this is sort of a dumbed down version of the the page allocator that exists in the extended library it's a bit more complicated than that but but the this is sort of the meat that I want to focus on and in an allocation what we do is we'll just go ahead and request a memory from the operating system and in a POSIX system that's a memory map or M map and upon freeing it we just call memory unmet and this is very simple and almost

**6:22** · trivial and you might be wondering hey what's the catch we're like why why can't we use this why is this not actually recommended by Zig and there's a there's sort of a problem going on with this and for one thing system calls are very slow like in orders of magnitude slower than a typical function

**6:42** · execution even and this is because of a number of things I have to relating with memory protection and interrupts and and jumping into kernel space all that stuff is very slow just to to execute and it refreshes how the CPU wants to view memory so if you're doing many of these

**7:03** · allocations this is actually going to be a massive slow point in your program if you're allocating for instance a dozen different nodes in it for your link list every time you ask the operating system for a node it's going to be super slow and it's not not not a good way of run

**7:22** · and the other problem is that it is very wasteful you may have seen this align forward and wondering what what the hell is going on here and that's because operating system has a very stripped down view of memory it does not understand memory and bytes because if it was trying to figure out memory and bytes and be very slow and wasteful so the operating system actually operates the with operates has a view of memory in pages and a pages typically a four

**7:52** · kilobytes for most most modern operating systems and it's a 64 kilobytes on webassembly and that means that whenever you ask for memory you have to ask for a page or a multiple of a page so if you're asking for eight bytes for your link list well you can't you have to ask for four kilobytes and then your link list will use four kilobytes of that eight then a four bytes eight bytes of that four kilobytes and you're wasting 3.99 kilobytes every time

**8:21** · you're asking for a memory so this is really bad in two different very very catastrophic ways so now the flipside you may be asking is if it's so bad why do you want to use the the operating system at all and the answer is the operating system actually has all the memory that's available when you run

**8:42** · your program you typically don't map all the memory that you need directly into your program immediately so you need some way of asking the operating system for more memory now you can start with all of the memory map but that means that your your memory usage is governed by how much maximum memory you have at

**8:59** · all times so if at a maximum you need a one gigabyte of memory you map one gigabyte when you start out and that's that's not ideal because if most of the time you only need like maybe ten megabytes then the extra memory is wasteful it may not start up and it's just all sorts of all sorts of I can't think of the word not

**9:22** · not optimal an optimal there we go so that's why you want to ask the operating system for more memory and this is sort of the basis of most allocators but it's also not what most people use as allocators directly again it could be very wishful so instead of instead of just like trusting

**9:41** · someone else how about we actually implement one this way we have a little bit more control of what's going on so what is the simplest allocation that we can or what is the simplest algorithm that we can do and that's called a bump alligator and it's it's in Zig we

**9:57** · provide a bump alligator in the form of a fixed buffer alligator we we use a fixed buffer to back a single alligator and the alligator all it does is stores an extra extra field called the end index and as you allocate you bump the end index upwards and you create these segments of memory at the bottom of the buffer or at the top depending on your strategy um but as you allocate more

**10:23** · memory you just bump the pointer upwards a bit and that way you actually track how much free space you have left and also you track how much how much memory you have previously consumed so there are a number of big there are a number of downsides to this but the big benefit is that this is very simple it's very simple and it's very fast so because allocating memory is just a couple of additions comparison plus and

**10:50** · that's really it you get very fast allocation and you get a little bit more control over the lifetime it's not fully controlled because depending on where you put the buff so your lifetime is now controlled by where your buffer lives as opposed to where your variable is and that gives it a little bit more flexibility you can move the buffer from this current stack upwards into the stack that gives it a bit longer lifetime or you can even move it out to the global space it's still not like complete control over where it is but it's it's a lot better so you

**11:22** · won't accidentally like start pointing into you know accidentally pointing into a free memory that's that's no longer part of the map stack but there are still major problems with this a couple of probably the biggest problem that we have is that your memory still still

**11:40** · fixed we call it the fixed buffer allocator because your buffer is fixed we can't expand it in any way so once you're you run out of free face then there's nothing you can do and you just sort of hold your hand and be like well we're out of memory and this is even worse because you can't actually free memory now we can sort of with the wiggle our wave around and say oh you can free memory you'd have free the last allocated memory it's like it's in this instance we can free the 32 byte because

**12:13** · it's it's at the last spot and we can detect that but we can't actually free the 8 bytes at the very beginning or the 4 bytes in the middle there's no data structure just sort of that because all we're starting storing is an end index so free is very limited and the only way to properly free is to do a first-in first-out approach which when you work with manual memory management that you it's very hard to guarantee that so in

**12:36** · most respects you could treat it as you can't free memory and any free memory that you actually get is sort of an optimization and not not an actual like something that you can depend on so yeah we can free the last allocation but the other thing that we can do is we can reset the entire buffer because the allocation because we're storing the end

**12:57** · pointer we can just be like oh the end pointer let's point at the beginning so even though we can't really free individual memory and trying to free it free it by with the last allocation is brittle we can actually reset the entirety if we know that this the data that's inside this buffer is no longer being used we can just go ahead and flush it and start from scratch and that that's actually very fast and that's a valid way of reusing your your your

**13:25** · buffer space but so let's skip and let's ignore the fact that you can't really free memory right now and let's talk about fixed total memory ah personally this is kind of a bigger blocker for me because like there are often times I don't know how much memory I need if I'm writing parsing code I don't really I can just keep guessing until I get the right number of a free memory but that seems very not fun so what what can we

**13:50** · do to lift this a lift this idea of a fixed total of memory like what if we could have a bump allocator with expandable memory so instead of having one fixed buffer how about we have expandable buffers so here we have we just basically we fill up individual buffers and every time we fill up a buffer we'll just go ahead and we'll create a new buffer and if we fill that up will create a new buffer this way we have unlimited memory as long as we can create buffers and we still have the bump alligator style where we're just moving up the pointer and that's

**14:23** · still going to be really fast I may be asking well where where are the buffers coming from and the answer is this bump that this type of alligator requires a backing allocators or so something else needs to be providing the actual memory that's that's happening and just so happens we just explored one of the alligators and that's that's the operating system so we'll have tux here give us all our memory for us and this

**14:46** · way we have the capability of having expandable memory while mitigating most of the downsides of of hitting the operating system and asking for more memory so if you for instance if you start allocating a bunch of linked lists inside this new alligator which we're going to call arena alligator we're actually just going to be bumping up the memory here and we don't we very rarely will need to ask the operating system for more memory so this is a lot more prep performant and it sort of mixes two

**15:20** · alligators together and gets the best perform best characteristics of both and again it's very fast allocation because it's still bumping you have expandable memory which is good and the other great thing is that you have fully controlled manual lifetimes previously with our fixed buffer we're still governed by where the buffer lives but now since we're actually asking the operating system for memory we can control when that free happens so whenever you're

**15:48** · done with it you can't free individual memory that's still not allowed but you can free all of the memory that we have requested and that just goes directly back into the operating system and not being able to free individual memory that sounds like a sort of a limitation and it is but however there are many many types of problems that you can actually get away with not free individual memory and the two big two to that there are two big categories of

**16:17** · of algorithms that free individual memory may not be that great the first one is if you have lots of allocations for one one lifetime freeing individual memory is not actually that useful if you think if you use malloc before in the past and you build a linked list and then you have to free that linked list you have to go through and iterate through with each individual node to figure out where whether to actually go

**16:43** · and free it so if you have like a hundred nodes you have to redo a hundred different free if freeing you have to three hundred different nodes individually it would be nice if we could free them all at once and you can with an arena you stick everything all

**16:58** · of those nodes inside of a single arena you put it at the top of the tree or the list in this case and then you can just go ahead and free all of them at once and that's that's a much faster operation because you're not iterating through a bunch of nodes and it's it's one operation because you have basically one chunk of memory to store all of that the other the other a slightly more fuzzy approach is that if you don't have

**17:22** · to free individual memory if your lifetime is known and you can get away with a little bit of temporary garbage space then you don't need to free individual memory and you still have the easy lifetime of the arena so so in this

**17:39** · case for instance a web request you can structure your arena in a way where you create the arena at the beginning of a request and you you free the memory at the at the end of the request and everything in between is automatically cleaned up for you and this this while

**17:58** · it's not ideal because your if your if your individual request actually allocates like Meg's of memory and then tries to free them it's still gonna be hanging around with until the request is finished but it also protects you from leaking a memory outward if in case you didn't free it so this this is if you have an own lifetime apply an arena can make your system a lot even more resilient to like manual memory

**18:29** · management hols that you may have forgotten so this is actually a very popular strategy in Zig we do it all the time and Senate Library does it for like parsing it does it for other type of handling and it's it's a surprisingly flexible strategy however there's still problem with not being able to free memory I'm not saying that it doesn't happen because it always does so what do we do about free memory like how do we make this memory

**18:59** · allocation general-purpose and the easy solution is we just create some metadata and I stop stick it in a free list now how that works is looking at looking at this code here let's let's skip ahead to the free algorithm and instead of returning the memory anywhere we're just going to create a linked list node out of the memory and will append it to our prepended I'm sorry prepended into our little free list tree here and

**19:29** · then whenever we need to allocate new memory we can go ahead and we find up matching sites and this way we are creating a linked list of these nodes and each of these nodes can be of a different size and then we can basically find it again if we need more and if we can't find a match we size that means oh we don't have the existing memory we're gonna have to actually go in create a new memory and this does work this does work you can free memory you have some way of storing free memory and there's a that's really our goal right

**20:04** · well there are major problems with this approach and for the first thing that that is that allocations have a limited size in order for us to free memory we need to be able to start in a linked list so we need at least an X pointer and the next pointer has a minimum size of what 8 bytes on a typical 64-bit machine and so whenever you allocate one byte we have to bump that up to at least eight bytes in order to free memory or we can just go ahead and never be able

**20:35** · to free anything less than eight bytes there's a trade-off there but the point is that we have some issues with that this is also very slow in order to allocate in order to allocate memory here we we all sudden converted this from a from a a constant time to a

**20:57** · linear time because we're actually scanning through the entire list in order to find a free memory that's oh of one and that's going to be slow and that's not ideal it's possible for it to be to the memory that you're looking for is in the front of the list but there's no guarantees it and there's also a problem with fragmentation now this is this gets into other considerations but like say if you allocate for eight bytes and then allocate 1 byte and then you allocate 7 bytes ignoring the fact that

**21:31** · we can't really free those things that one byte of allocation is actually segmenting your memory and preventing it from being used ideally so you free these chunks of memory now you have an eight one and seven chunks even though it could be 16 bytes and that's that that leads to horrible degradation of performance the longer your program is running and there's no such thing as a

**21:56** · defragmenting your memory because you have pointers that go everywhere and it you can't really track them down so this becomes a huge concern and this is just even though this works for like our general purpose this is not ideal and I almost don't want to use this because it's so bad so we fix some of these problems and so the answer is what if we introduce a concept of size buckets now we have now we have

**22:24** · different lists for different sizes and the big thing that happens here is if you have a different size for or sorry if you have a different list for different size the first access into that list is guaranteed to be the right size so instead of instead of traversing

**22:41** · through the entire list of things you only need to find one value you only need to find the first value if it exists in the list then that's good that's what you're looking for if it doesn't exist well it's empty you don't have to look through the entire list and that's really good and for a fragmentation it's a bit it dissipate more mitigated let's put it that way we no longer have a one-bite challenge or 7bi chunks or whatever everything's a fixed size so for

**23:08** · something like a 1 by we'll just bump it up to 8 bytes for something like 10 by 10 bytes of requested memory we'll bump it up to 16 bytes and that way we have our nice limited trees as well as reducing the contention of memory fragmentation it's not completely gone but it's a lot more mitigated because like I'm pretty sure that we can reuse 8 bytes or 16 bytes or 32 bytes I have a hard time of thinking about reusing

**23:34** · something like a 13 by chunk so we can definitely reuse these it's just that it's still not ideal because you still get some fragmentation so it's not all gone and then the limitation is allocation have a fixed size that actually is a little bit of a problem because now allocations you you can have waste wasted memory and allocations if you're asking for 10 buys and you get 16 buys that's 6 bytes wasted that's not a lot at a small scale but it can again accrue up to a pretty large numbers so

**24:08** · any other problems with that with this approach and the answer is it's a little bit subtle but the bigger problem here is we have cash pressure and modern computers modern CPUs are very fast they're so fast that they're like hundreds of times faster memory so whenever you run out of cash you have a cache miss then you have to actually access random memory and that's really slow and the

**24:35** · way that we structure any sort of linked lists you almost guarantee to run into cache problems and that's because of the way that the linked lists are written where you your your nodes can jump all over the place in memory there's actually no structure whatsoever in the naive approach and it's very hard to actually keep the structure and when

**24:54** · you're allocating a single bits of memory at a time that this is not really a problem I mean it is a problem because you have cache pressure but it's guaranteed to be a it's guaranteed to be a cache miss anyway if you're allocating sporadically like this this data structure is not going to be in the cache but if you're allocating very quickly like say in a loop unit allocate ten different uh free nodes then every access to this node is going to be a cache miss can be a cache miss because

**25:23** · it's jumping all over the place in memory and that's really bad there are ways to mitigate that by instead of allocating ten nodes by themselves you can allocate ten those at a time and that's called like that's a strategy called object pooling and that works really well but that's outside of the allocation Allen outside of the allocator how what if we can do something to the allocator to make it make this type of behavior better

**25:51** · because this is actually a pretty common use case we don't want to always be like oh hey you're using my allocated well you should probably pull everything together because yeah you probably good because it's a better approach by default but a lot of people may not be thinking about this and also like even if you are thinking about this there are times where you are you don't necessarily know the total number that you want to pull in and pulling together it may either give you too little which is not which is which you need to expand

**26:22** · memory which is a slow again or do you need however you allocate too much in which case you're taking up a lot more memory that you need so is there anything that we can do to make our memory more cache friendly and yes we can because we can actually instead of using a linked list we should be using arrays or Rea's are much faster and much friendlier to the cpu nowadays and this gets into a slight allocator and a slab is sort of harkens back to our arena

**26:54** · allocator where as we instead of having these buffers there now canal called slabs and each slab is uh is segmented in a way that the entire slab has has the same amount of memory and this has a very nice characteristic that linear memory our amount of memory that are allocated next to each other have a much higher chance of being actually next to each other so if you in our case if if we try to allocate for four nodes from

**27:26** · the first size they're going to plug in right the right at the four bright areas and two of them are literally right next to each other and they're all very close by and slab allocator will guarantee that whenever you access whenever you allocate memory it's going to be probably pretty close to each other we can't guarantee that because obviously we can't guarantee how the memory can be

**27:52** · freed but this has a much higher likelihood of being next to each other than using a linked list because because of the way the algorithm structure and also we still have the fixed and fixed sizing so that we can access different sizes pretty easily and this actually

**28:08** · fixes most of our problems with what we had before allocation still have to fix size that's sort of a problem but we're no longer very slow we don't we don't actually have traditional memory fragmentation anymore because our memory

**28:24** · will be fixed sizes so there's no such thing as memory fragmentation in our case because everything that's on the eight byte slab will be guaranteed to be eight bytes you can't fragment that and we got rid of a lot of the cache pressure so this sounds like this is great so what's the catch here and there's a catch and that's the meta storage depending on how you store the metadata it can be it can cause problems and basically if you want

**28:50** · to store the metadata outside of the slabs that's possibility but now you have an external set of memory that to manage and that has its own characteristics you can run out of external memory and that would be really bad and also it's another external memory which means it's another cache problem if you put it internally inside the slab that actually takes up a spot in in your slab so like for instance it takes up at least one element in your slab so if you have a if your slab is

**29:24** · one kilobyte of blocks at a time then your metadata will actually take up an entire kilobyte even though you only need ten bytes there so that is not ideal and that's pretty wasteful so there are again more mitigation strategies and it's probably going far beyond far beyond uh sort of the content

**29:46** · that I can cover it here but there's actually a lot more going on that I sort of gloss over so we have all these other ideas that we probably need to solve because alligators need to sort of invent and understand these things alignments a big contention especially with the modern day a lot of things require memory alignment for eye things like sim D and and GPU work if their

**30:13** · memory is not aligned you actually can't access it and alignment requires its own little algorithm to calculate everything correctly see compatibility we don't actually care about a lot of that in Zig because our Zig allocate and free

**30:28** · carries the metadata around see the when you free memory and see it doesn't actually you don't pass the size back so that size needs to be accessed somehow by the memory allocator so that idea nice if you want malloc and free compatibility you need to start worrying about additional ways of how to store your data there's also like threading everything that I've talked about just ignored concept of threads if you it the

**30:56** · naive way is using locks but that's actually a really slow so a more modern way is that you actually have different different affinity for memory so different different threads will get different blocks of data so like a slab will only on one one thread that's thread-local at that point other ideas memory efficiency we talked about corruption if you accidentally do a buffer overrun does it do you write garbage into the middle of your memory

**31:24** · into your metadata which is really bad or do you write accidentally right to some data which is a lot less bad potentially or do you write to additional buffer which is actually could be okay that that could be a way to to work around buffer overruns by

**31:41** · just allocating a lot more data and there's all the debugging and binary size so there's a lot of these things that has to happen in any sort of alligators and the point is that there is it is impossible to make an alligator to do everything well and even though we call it a general-purpose alligator or we there's not actually one true general

**32:05** · purpose alligator that's why we have lots and lots of different algorithms and I personally believe that zig is in a great spot for allocation because of the way that we structured it so there is no default alligator we have to make decisions around all of these things and that I believe that that's a good thing and once even if we get a general-purpose alligator which we don't right now because writing one is hard but even if we do I'm hoping that because allocated allocation can be

**32:35** · tricky and you can have different ideas of what you want out of your alligator that we can still keep this idea of okay we're gonna use an arena here we can use general-purpose here we can use a different general purpose here because we we need some debugging thing to do and mixing and matching alligators in zig is a lot easier than almost every other language like C has malloc everyone uses malloc that means you can't really swap out and C++ has new

**33:02** · ones you lead and almost everything has a default and because it doesn't have a default I think it's in a better spot not in terms of allowing you to manually manage all of this memory and that's really the meat of what I have I can be found sometimes streaming on Twitch and I've written my own little

**33:22** · general-purpose allocator for Maya for our web assembly it is targeted towards web assembly so I made the trade-offs of I don't care about threading and I'm trying to squeeze it down as small as possible and I am trying to convert it

**33:40** · into a slab alligator and I guess we'll see how well that goes thank you very much for having me on Benjamin let's switch to the Q&amp;A now then just a reminder to the people to

**33:59** · the viewers to ask a question to Benjamin remember to tag me in the chat message so I don't tell other miss it you can send a message on twitch chat you can send a message on this code or also the zg IRC channel on freenode so i will be monitoring all these places let's switch to the Q&amp;A now

### Interview

**34:20** · you you okay so while people start thinking questions if they have any let's start with a few basic questions so how are

**34:38** · you Benjamin how do you feel this is your second talk right so was it easier than the first time what yeah how do you feel in general I'm feeling okay definitely a little bit more nervous because this this topic is something that I'm familiar with but yeah I'm enjoying myself so far I hope that everyone else is too yeah I've seen

**35:05** · quite a few positive messages on Twitch at least so I think people appreciate it and I remember before the show started there were a few people like Timmy and and somebody else that we're interested in knowing more about alligators and in seeing in particular because as you pointed out it's a bit of a Ziggy is in a bit of a peculiar situation when it comes to to alligator so let's see a couple of questions that we have already I'm curious about memory alignment when

**35:37** · using an alligator do I need to care about memory alignment for a block of memory that I give to the user or or alignment of headers that the locator use yeah so in Zig I sort of had a

**35:55** · dumbed down version of this method signature there but we actually care about the alignment that the user is requesting so the alignment of the headers and the metadata it doesn't matter outside of your alligator so you can put that anywhere you want to provided that your alligator is able to access them but for the consumer they need the memory to be aligned and so typically

**36:21** · the limited in at least Sealand is 16-bit a line or 16 byte Alliance I'm sorry and that that allows for a 128-bit memory which goes well into sim D registers but that's sort of that's sort of the implicit alignment for form a lock for Zig we actually pass around the request at alignment and you have to

**36:45** · match the requested alignment whenever you give back the alternative approach is if you can't actually give a lineman like that you can just return out of memory and that's a valid strategy and now I would argue that your your memory allocator is not quite general purpose but maybe that's good enough trade-off and again that speaks to how how Zig works that you're allowed to make these trade-offs if you don't need any sort of special alignment it's easier to do just standard 4-bit alignment and if that's a

**37:17** · disadvantage that you're comfortable with you can actually write allocators like that whereas in c Malick has to align to at least I think 16 bytes on on x86 system nowadays could be even higher now with AVX instructions but like Zig gives us the flexibility of treating that alignment how you want to well we

**37:41** · have another question could we plug in something like oh now that I think about it I don't know how to pronounce the name yeah my look je ma look yeah okay so is it we actually have a way to expose a C allocator and you just leave the Lib C link Lipsy into it and you can link any malloc compatible layer into Zig and that'll work actually that works

**38:08** · quite well the problem is that again C malloc is only 16 bit of line if you need more alignment see malloc won't provide that for you but if you need a general-purpose allocator right now the the sort of the the official approach is

**38:27** · that yeah you can just link in whatever C is seam allocator you want to and it should just work okay so the solution that you're proposing is so one way would be just to link against that by selecting the right library but there was a second part of the question so just to cover everything it would still be possible to like create a seek je

**38:50** · malloc like project on github where you link the the the C library and provide your own like Zeke or seek like interface right tweet oh you don't need to provide the sig like interface that's actually the standard library provides a sig like interface on top of NEC Malik so you don't need a writer one for that you just pull in I think it's STD keep that C allocator and it'll just work as long as you linked in a live C and G Malik is one of

**39:23** · them I don't know if that's the standard but it's definitely becoming the standard of a lot of different systems so you have to cuss so whatever your Lipsy is whatever i'm malik it uses but yeah you can just you can just the shims are already provided for you mm-hmm so which one okay doesn't have the fixed size problem which so most alligators

**39:49** · don't have a fixed size problem the fixed buffer alligator is the one that does that is fixed and it really depends on sort of the strategy that you're providing recognizing that having a fixed size is probably not the best approach most alligators will not have a fixed size the reason that fixed buffer alligator is fixed is because it's simple and it's fast those are two very

**40:13** · good qualities that you want and if you're able to make the trade-off there that's why you want if you don't care about expanding memory you should almost always want to use fixed buffer because it's just fast but if you need any sort of expanding memory or you need a free memory then that's when you want to venture out and use a different one so there's only one that's really fixed because there's no other no reason to use a fixed buffer alligator otherwise because the fixed buffer alligator is probably the fastest that you'll ever get yeah I remember using the fixed

**40:44** · buffer orkut or a bunch of times I think while I was writing tests for my already's client library and so since I was controlling the input I knew how much memory needed and this was really the fastest way of having like writing the test making work and also have a test run fast so that's maybe a bit of a

**41:05** · peculiar use case but that's one of the fees well so there is another question that I think Timmy wanted everybody to answer but I'm gonna pose it to you so that also you can have an opportunity of contributing and he is asking why is something like

**41:21** · Jay Malik considered very fast even while being a general purpose allocate or is this a relative or something else I mean the speed is always going to be relative using Chi Malik will never be as fast as using a specific one for a specific algorithm so you can always tune whatever algorithm you have to have a faster characteristic however for being a general-purpose allocator Jimmy Malik is very fast and almost it you

**41:52** · almost want to use jamala as the backing allocator for a lot of different things like for instance if you're allocating dozens of linked list nodes it's probably faster than pre-allocate that at once instead of allocating each individual one and to do that you'll just allocate an array of 24 of these

**42:13** · nodes and that's one 1 allocation column that's guaranteed to be fast on almost any system if you allocate one at a time probably going to be slower but it's going to be a lot less slower on something like Jim Alok as opposed to something like the free list one that I built but myself which is horrendous so

**42:32** · yes there are trade-offs and yes jamala isn't ideal for for and probably any specific problem but it's good enough for almost every problem and that's why it's used so heavily and generally you want a general-purpose algorithm that makes these trade-offs and has like 90 percent performance before almost every

**42:56** · non degenerate case you can throw at it and that's what makes a general-purpose it's never gonna be great it's never gonna be the best and it's never gonna be perfect but it may be good enough that it doesn't matter mm-hmm so there's a comment from Andrew I related to Jay Malik where he says that he would be interested in seeing a port of the entire library rather than trying to use it directly yeah that's that's a possibility Jamie Malick is not non-trivial looking at the code size of

**43:28** · that is it's pretty big and there's a lot of different concepts going on I mean it's it's it's a project of like decades of experience most of the process I've presented is just one or two of them Jim Alec probably uses like a dozen or two dozen different strategies that actually works together so yes that's definitely something that we would like to do but it's also probably very complicated and might take a full-time staff to work on properly at

**43:58** · least to get it off the road so it's possible but it's also it's complicated for a good reason and also because it's so complicated I refuse to use it in webassembly because I think the output size of Jim Alec was like 500 kilobytes and that's a little bit ridiculous so I don't I don't personally use it because I write a lot of stuff in webassembly and forcing to download half a megabyte of binary is just a little bit ridiculous so again trade-offs it's fast

**44:30** · it's pretty performant it takes a lot of binary space to for it to actually work there's a so this is a question from me I remember reading recently that there was a new alligator strategy that was a research paper that I think made the news a while ago where basically they were adopting a strategy where they would map they would try to allocate

**44:57** · none so let's say that you have two pages they would try to over to allocate non-overlapping areas on memory of the two pages and then they will be able to merge the two pages together right have you had an experience with that or opinions I've watched the talk on it and

**45:16** · it's interesting that the thing that they're doing is that when you allocate arbitrary memory it's very easy for your memory to be fragmented to hell and one of the strategies to how to defragment this is by merging pages if you if you have two different pages and they don't have you overlapping used memory most operating system allows you to just glue the two pages together they still look like theyd they're separate but underneath the covers in the virtual virtual machine virtual page memory

**45:46** · thing it's actually one continuous block of memory and this allows you to merge pages and reclaim a lot of fragmentation I don't know how any of that works I don't really work with operating systems this requires a lot of in-depth knowledge of how each individual operating system works with these pages and how to actually merge them together there there's their solution is literally to just randomize which pages on and that works better than like 90% of every other solution including linear

**46:16** · scan so somehow randomizing the data makes the random fragments easier to compress so it's it's interesting it sounds impressive I don't know much beyond just the video that I saw okay so so the questions are getting harder so I think I will conclude with the hard question it's not precisely a question but it's a discussion that's going on on the IRC channel on freenode and I don't know maybe you had an opinion that so there's a such a sh CB on IRC that is asking

**46:50** · just curious but would it be possible to make a garbage collecting a locator um I think the answer is yes I've actually seen one written by Jimmy it was pretty

**47:06** · old and this was before I really understood a memory allocation so it looks like it's possible I don't really know how it works because traditional garbage collectors require tracing and we don't actually have a good way of tracing memory usage in in our metadata

**47:21** · space our like most memory manually memory managed memory spaces don't have a good way of tracing I mean it's possible we could build like a pseudo graph on top of that but I don't really know how it works but because one was written already I'm inclined to say probably it's possible okay so some food

**47:44** · for thought for for the for the people watching well that was awesome Thank You Benjamin is there anything else you want to say before we move to the break okay very

**48:00** · much I will say for you make sure to check out a history channel that's twitch.tv slash Frank B is that correct yes so make sure to watch and to asking questions about memory allocation webassembly Game Boy emulators and stuff like that so thank you very much man Jimmy again okay so now we are moving to the break
